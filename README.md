NOTICE: You must download the wordlist in order for this program to work! Also, it currently does not calculate points with blanks accurately.

This Python program asks the user for a given input rack (that may or may not include letters from the board). It then displays the best possible options to form a word.
Note that it always includes a bingo if the result word is at least 7 letters, because it can't tell when a letter is on the board or on the player's rack.
I'll probably update that code in the future, but welcome anybody who knows how to do it to try!
Hope you find it useful!
